### Hi, I'm Anastasia ðŸ‘‹
I'm a beginner designer with academic and practical work experience. For me, being a designer is a perfect job.

Since I didn't have enough knowledge and experience in design, I went to study at Skillbox and Synergy University. I'm finishing my studies in the fields of "Visual Communications Designer" and "Digital Design and Work in Figma", where I learned to work with Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, After effects, Tilda and much more. I'm also independently studying Power BI and PowerPoint, Tableau.

I can create a simple telegram bot or a website for a tarot reader, as well as analyze the workflow for an organization of 5,000 people and create dashboards for it.

I already have several cases, you can find them on the site.

Before becoming a designer, I worked in the field of document management. I started my career as a receptionist and grew to become a department manager. Over the years of working as a manager, I encountered various situations: from a lack of personnel to working with colleagues assigned from other departments to temporarily strengthen the team (the number of subordinates varied from 2 to 12 people). I analyzed the statistics and found out that the amount of incoming correspondence grows by an average of 30% every year, and optimized the training of specialists and the processing of documentation to reduce the labor costs of subordinates.
