### Hi, I'm Anastasiya ðŸ‘‹
I am a junior Analyst with more than a year of practical experience. For me, Analytics is an ideal job. 

Since I didn't have enough knowledge and experience in Analytics, I went to study at GeekBrains. I am finishing my studies at the Faculty of Development with a degree in Analytics, where I learned how to work with SQL and Python, Power BI and PowerPoint, and much more. I also study Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Figma, Tableau on my own.

I can create a simple telegram bot or a website for a tarologist, and I can also analyze the workflow for an organization of 5,000 people and create dashboards for it.

I already have several cases, they can be found on my resume website http://ashchuga.tilda.ws/

Before becoming an analyst, I worked in document management. She started her career as a receptionist and grew up to be the Head of the department. Over the years, the manager has faced various situations from staff shortages to working with colleagues allocated from other departments to temporarily strengthen the team (the number of subordinates ranged from 2 to 12). I analyzed the statistics and found out that the number of incoming correspondence grows by 30% on average every year and optimized the training of specialists and the processing of documentation to reduce the labor costs of subordinates.
